## V18.1 fixes
- Tablet-only (901–1100px) navigation compaction so labels stay on one line.

- Existing phone/mobile navigation at 900px and below remains unchanged.
- Contact now receives the active blue navigation state at the bottom of the page.

- 520ms fluid easing in both scroll directions.
- V18.1 active state remains as a fail-safe until the animated pill is confirmed positioned.
- Does not alter nav flex layout.
- Mobile <=900px unchanged.
- Test-only build: no CNAME; noindex/nofollow.
